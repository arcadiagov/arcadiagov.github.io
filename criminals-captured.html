      <h2>RAMP Confirms Capture and Trial of High-Profile Cyber Traitors</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 14, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        In a coordinated cross-border operation led by the Royal Arcadian Mounted Police (RAMP), several fugitives previously accused of cyber crimes and treason were successfully apprehended and brought to trial. The individuals, operating from deep within Bradictorian territory, were extracted with the cooperation of neutral informants and tried in accordance with the Kingdom’s most stringent national security laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charges included cyber espionage, unauthorized data transmission, conspiracy to undermine national systems, and sedition under Section 15 and Section 30 of the Arcadian Penal Code. Their trial before the High Tribunal concluded in unanimous verdicts of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
        “They believed the shadows would protect them,” declared His Lordship the Lord High King. “But Arcadia never sleeps when its sovereignty is under threat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        All convicted parties received sentences ranging from permanent digital confinement to exile and forced conscription into state-controlled cybersecurity workforces.
      </p>
      <p>
        International observers from the Great Gheetan Empire confirmed that the trials adhered to recognized legal norms and applauded Arcadia’s “resolve and precision in upholding digital sovereignty.”
