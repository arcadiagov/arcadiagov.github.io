      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        The fugitive Logan Boucher, formerly a subject of the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia, is hereby declared wanted for Imperial Treason and related crimes. Boucher is charged with undermining national integrity, evading rightful prosecution, and endangering Arcadian diplomatic stability.
        <br><br>
        His actions, as evaluated by the High Council and the Office of National Sovereignty, constitute egregious violations of Arcadian law. These acts were executed in breach of the Executive Oath of Allegiance and resulted in considerable harm to the Kingdom’s internal and external relations.
        <br><br>
        Any persons found to be aiding Logan Boucher in any capacity—including but not limited to harboring, concealing, or assisting in evasion—will be charged with High Treason and Obstruction of Justice.
        <br><br>
        This warrant is in immediate effect and shall remain active until the accused is secured and presented before the Royal Arcadian Judicial Assembly.
