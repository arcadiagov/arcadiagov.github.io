      <h2>Declaration of Sovereignty and Termination of Union</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">Issued June 4, 2025 – Royal Capital, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        By the Will of the Crown, the Voice of the Realm, and the Authority of the High King, the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia hereby declares the full restoration and affirmation of its **sovereign independence**, unbound by any foreign dominion, coercive treaty, or imperial claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        This declaration is made in direct response to the hostile and unlawful actions of the Great Gheetan Empire, which include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Issuance of an imperial arrest warrant for the High King of Arcadia;</li>
        <li>Unauthorized surveillance and seizure of classified Arcadian material;</li>
        <li>Attempted imposition of foreign legal authority over Arcadian governance;</li>
        <li>Appointment of a foreign regent without consultation or consent;</li>
        <li>Denial of Arcadia’s sovereign status, and violation of multiple clauses of the Treaty of Eternal Union.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In light of these grave and repeated treaty breaches, and the direct threat posed to the leadership and autonomy of Arcadia, the <strong>Treaty of Eternal Union</strong> is hereby declared **null, void, and extinguished in full**.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia henceforth regards itself as fully sovereign and self-governing, subject only to its own constitution, crown, and laws. No law, command, or court of the Great Gheetan Empire shall hold force or recognition within the territory of the Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        This act is not rebellion—it is a restoration of truth. The High King of Arcadia was never a vassal, nor shall ever be made one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let this declaration serve as final notice to the Great Gheetan Empire, and as formal confirmation to all nations, allies, and peoples who value freedom, that Arcadia stands alone, sovereign, and unshaken.
      </p>

      <p class="signature">
        — His Majesty, High King M. Blakney<br />
        Sovereign of the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia<br />
