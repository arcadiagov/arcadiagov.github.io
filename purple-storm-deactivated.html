      <h2>Bradictoria Deactivates CODE PURPLE STORM, Adopts CODE IRON SHIELD</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 16, 2025 – Port Grandhall, Bradictoria</p>
      <p>
        In a conciliatory move aimed at easing regional tensions, the Government of Bradictoria has officially deactivated CODE PURPLE STORM. The protocol—initially triggered amid dubious claims of external aggression—has been retired in favor of a more measured defensive posture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>📜 OFFICIAL RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF BRADICTORIA</strong><br>
        To: His Imperial Majesty, Sovereign of the Great Gheetan Empire<br>
        From: The High Command and Government of Bradictoria
      </p>
      <p>
        “We extend our appreciation for your thoughtful and principled dialogue. We wish to confirm that CODE PURPLE STORM has been fully deactivated. It was never intended as a weapon of aggression, but rather as an internal readiness measure to safeguard our nation in uncertain times,” the statement read.
      </p>
      <p>
        In its place, Bradictoria has enacted <strong>CODE IRON SHIELD</strong>, a comprehensive homeland security framework focused on:
        <ul>
          <li>🔒 Protection of critical infrastructure and energy grids</li>
          <li>🛡️ Fortification of border checkpoints and ports</li>
          <li>🚨 Enhanced coordination among civil defense and emergency services</li>
          <li>📡 Continuous intelligence surveillance of external communications</li>
          <li>👥 Strict vetting of personnel in key government ministries</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        “This new initiative is purely defensive and precautionary,” the communique emphasized. “It remains fully within the boundaries of peaceful governance and is not directed at your Empire or its Realms.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Bradictoria also noted that <strong>additional security measures</strong> have been implemented in response to threats posed by international actor Rowan Miller. “All personnel are to exercise heightened vigilance,” the statement concluded.
