      <h2>State of Emergency Extended Amid Continued Terrorist Threat</h2>
      <p><em>May 1, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</em></p>
      <p>
        The Kingdom of Arcadia remains under an ongoing state of emergency following the emergence of additional terrorist threats targeting national security. Intelligence officials have reported increased activity and coordination among hostile elements, prompting an extension of emergency measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We are not out of danger,” said the Lord High King in a private session with the High Council. “The enemies of Arcadia grow bolder, but our resolve shall remain unshaken. The lockdown will persist until we can be assured of the Kingdom’s full safety.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizens are advised to continue exercising extreme caution, maintain secure communications, and comply with all directives issued by the Ministry of Internal Security. Surveillance protocols remain fully active, and breaches will be treated as acts of treason under the Arcadian Penal Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security officials stress that the situation remains fluid. All Royal Guard units and defense agencies have been placed on elevated alert. Civil defense drills are scheduled in multiple provinces over the coming days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Updates will be issued as intelligence is verified and new directives are authorized by the Crown.
