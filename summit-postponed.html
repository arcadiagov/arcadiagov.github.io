      <h2>Intermicronational Summit Postponed Due to Bradictorian Absence</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 19, 2025 – Capital District, Gheetan Empire</p>
      <p>
        The anticipated trilateral summit between the leaders of the Kingdom of Arcadia, the Great Gheetan Empire, and the Empire of Bradictoria has been formally postponed. The meeting, originally scheduled to take place this afternoon in the Gheetan capital, was deferred following the unexpected unavailability of Emperor Bradley Christie of Bradictoria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Officials from both Arcadia and Gheetan expressed disappointment, but emphasized the importance of full participation in any discussion concerning intermicronational cooperation and regional stability. A joint statement released by the Arcadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Imperial Gheetan Chancellery confirmed that all parties remain committed to rescheduling the summit at the earliest mutually agreeable time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The summit was expected to address pressing matters of diplomatic normalization, cyber defense policy, and collective security frameworks among the three states.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further details regarding the new date and agenda of the summit will be announced as they are finalized.
