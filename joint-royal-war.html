     <h2>Joint War Operation Against Bradictoria Commences</h2>
<p class="timestamp">June 6, 2025</p>
<p>
  In response to the unprovoked and unlawful Bradictorian assault on Arcadian and Gavonian territories, the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia and the Territorial Government of the Gavonian Isles have formally initiated a joint military operation, codenamed <strong>“Operation Royal Resolve.”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The operation marks the first coordinated wartime campaign between Arcadia and the Gavonian Isles since the signing of their Mutual Defence and Strategic Cooperation Treaty earlier this week. It is aimed at securing regional stability, repelling Bradictorian aggression, and restoring peace through swift, lawful resistance.
</p>
<p>
  His Majesty the High King of Arcadia issued the following public statement:
</p>
<blockquote>
  “Bradictoria has crossed a line. Their strike on sovereign soil shall not go unanswered. Today, Arcadia and the Gavonian Isles rise not in conquest, but in defense of dignity, law, and the sovereign right of all free peoples to live unthreatened. We march not alone, but with unity.”
</blockquote>
<p>
  In a brief but fiery remark, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the Gavonian Isles was quoted as saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
  “Screw Bradictoria.”
</blockquote>
<p>
  A joint command center has been established in Arcadia to oversee operations. The High King of Arcadia and the Emperor of the Gavonian Isles remain in close communication, emphasizing the defensive and strategic nature of all engagements.
</p>
<p>
  The Government of Arcadia reiterates its commitment to lawful conduct, proportional response, and the restoration of diplomatic order—provided Bradictoria immediately ceases all hostile activity and issues formal reparations.
