      <h2>Gheetan Attempts to Alter Treaty; Arcadia Rejects Unilateral Changes</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 21, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        The Kingdom of Arcadia has issued a formal rejection of unilateral edits proposed by the Great Gheetan Empire to the Treaty of Eternal Union. The Empire’s recent attempt to alter key terms of the agreement without mutual consent has been labeled "illegitimate and legally void" by Arcadian officials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arcadia firmly maintains that the original treaty—signed and ratified by both states—is the only legally binding version. Any attempts to revise its contents outside of proper diplomatic procedure are considered a breach of treaty protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Arcadia stands by the signed agreement and will not recognize changes made without our explicit consent," stated a spokesperson for the High Council. "The sanctity of international agreements must be preserved if peace and cooperation are to be maintained."
      </p>
      <p>
        The High King has emphasized the importance of respecting international law and the sovereignty of all signatory states. The government has assured the public that Arcadia will not be coerced into accepting amendments that undermine its national interests or constitutional integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diplomatic advisors warn that if Gheetan continues to act outside the bounds of the original treaty, it may be interpreted as a breach of trust and a violation of foundational diplomatic norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, Arcadia remains committed to the original text of the Treaty of Eternal Union and calls upon Gheetan to return to respectful and lawful diplomatic engagement.
