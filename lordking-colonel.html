     <p>
  In a historic moment of unity and strengthened alliance, the Lord High King of Arcadia has been officially commissioned as a Colonel in the Imperial Armed Forces of the Great Gheetan Empire. The appointment, signed into effect by His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Holden I, reinforces Arcadia’s full integration within the Imperial military framework and its unwavering loyalty to the Empire.

The promotion is both honorary and functional, aligning Arcadia’s military presence with the strategic goals of the Great Gheetan Empire.

  As a Colonel in the Imperial military, the Lord High King will:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Participate in high-level Imperial command meetings</strong> concerning joint defense strategies, coordination, and regional security.</li>
  <li><strong>Represent Arcadia on the Imperial War Council</strong> as an empowered military leader and sovereign ally.</li>
  <li><strong>Conduct ceremonial reviews and strategic briefings</strong> under the Empire’s unified military doctrine.</li>
  <li><strong>Lead Arcadian forces in joint operations</strong> during Empire-wide mobilizations or coordinated drills.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The commission has been celebrated across the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia as a powerful affirmation of its honored status within the Empire. The Lord High King's acceptance of the role is seen as a symbol of continued loyalty, stability, and shared destiny between Arcadia and Gheetan.
