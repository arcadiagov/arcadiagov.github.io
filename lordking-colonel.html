      <h2>Lord High King Promoted to Colonel in Imperial Forces</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 24, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        In a historic moment of reconciliation and renewed unity, the Lord High King of Arcadia has been formally commissioned as a Colonel in the Imperial Armed Forces of the Great Gheetan Empire. The appointment comes following an official pardon issued by His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Holden I, in recognition of the Lord High King's reaffirmed loyalty and commitment to the Empire’s divine order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ceremonial decree, signed from the Throne of the Great Gheetan Empire, grants the Lord High King the rank of Colonel with immediate effect. The promotion is both symbolic and functional, signifying Arcadia’s restored standing as a loyal realm and the personal trust extended by the Emperor to the Arcadian Crown.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Colonel in the Imperial military structure, the Lord High King will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Participate in strategic high command meetings</strong> related to realm defense and interrealm coordination.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve as Arcadia's military liaison</strong> to the Imperial War Council, ensuring Arcadian perspectives are represented in peace and conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>Oversee ceremonial and symbolic military functions</strong> in Arcadia under the Imperial banner.</li>
        <li><strong>Lead Arcadian forces under Imperial integration protocols</strong> during Empire-wide mobilizations or exercises.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Emperor’s gesture of mercy and inclusion has been widely praised within Arcadia and beyond. Loyalist leaders see the promotion as a unifying act that paves the way for continued collaboration, strength, and loyalty under Imperial law.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his acceptance address, the Lord High King stated: “With deep gratitude to His Imperial Majesty, I accept this honor not as a mark of conquest, but of concord. May Arcadia serve the Empire with faith and might.”
