      <h2>Bradictoria Activates CODE PURPLE STORM, Posing Direct Threat to Arcadia and Gheetan</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 16, 2025 – Port Grandhall, Bradictoria</p>
      <p>
        In a move widely condemned by foreign leaders, the Government of Bradictoria has formally activated CODE PURPLE STORM — a wartime protocol that signals full military readiness and offensive posturing. The decision is being interpreted by officials in both Arcadia and the Great Gheetan Empire as a direct and hostile threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The announcement came through a classified message intercepted by allied intelligence and later confirmed by Bradictorian state sources:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>⚠️ SECURE TRANSMISSION – EYES ONLY</strong><br>
        <em>From: The High Command of Bradictoria<br>
        Subject: ⚠️ Immediate Activation of CODE PURPLE STORM</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        “CODE PURPLE STORM IS NOW ACTIVE,” the message declared. “This status reflects a maximum alert condition in response to heightened external threats and coordinated aggression.” However, intelligence analysts point to the lack of credible military provocation, suggesting that Bradictoria is preparing for unilateral military escalation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this emergency directive:
        <ul>
          <li>🔒 Armed Forces are fully mobilized</li>
          <li>🏛️ Legislative processes have been suspended</li>
          <li>👑 Absolute executive power has been granted to Emperor Bradley Christie</li>
          <li>🏴‍☠️ Strategic lockdowns have commenced</li>
          <li>⚔️ Paramilitary militias have been activated nationwide</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        An aide to the Lord High King of Arcadia stated, “This is not a defensive measure. This is posturing for war. Bradictoria’s move endangers the entire regional balance.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Gheetan Empire has likewise responded with concern, calling the protocol “reckless, destabilizing, and a direct affront to civilized diplomacy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “This is not a drill,” the Bradictorian High Command warned. “When the storm comes, we do not retreat—we rise.”
