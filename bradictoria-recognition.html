      <h2>Empire Recognizes Bradictoria; Lennox Steeves Appointed Imperial Assistant</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 24, 2025 – Imperial Capital</p>
      <p>
        In a significant diplomatic development, the Great Gheetan Empire has officially recognized the sovereign legitimacy of the Dominion of Bradictoria. This formal recognition marks a new chapter in imperial-micronational relations and affirms Bradictoria's status as an independent and cooperative regional entity under the umbrella of imperial harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of this recognition, His Imperial Majesty has personally reassigned Lennox Steeves to serve as the Personal Assistant to the Emperor of Bradictoria, Emperor Bradley Christie. The appointment was made in a sealed imperial directive and is effective immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imperial officials praised Lennox Steeves for his long-standing loyalty, administrative competence, and unique familiarity with Bradictorian internal structures. His new role will include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Oversight of Protocol and Scheduling</strong> – Ensuring smooth coordination of imperial engagements with Bradictorian leadership.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Advisory to the Emperor</strong> – Acting as a key intermediary between Bradictoria and the Imperial Court.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and Communications Liaison</strong> – Maintaining secure and trusted communication lines with the Empire.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Emperor Bradley Christie issued a statement welcoming Steeves and reaffirming Bradictoria’s intention to work closely with the Empire while retaining its national identity. “This appointment is a mark of respect,” said the Emperor, “and Bradictoria will rise to the moment.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lord High King of Arcadia acknowledged the diplomatic shift with cautious optimism, noting, “We welcome peaceful and structured relations between all parties in the region. May this mark an end to clandestine hostilities.”
