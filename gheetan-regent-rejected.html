        <h2>Official Statement: Gheetan Regency Declaration Illegitimate</h2>
        <p class="timestamp">June 3, 2025</p>
        <p>
          The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia has been formally notified of the Gheetan Empire's unilateral attempt to impose a so-called "Regent" over Arcadian governance. The Government of Arcadia categorically rejects this decree as illegal, illegitimate, and in direct violation of the Treaty of Eternal Union.
        </p>
        <p>
          The treaty specifically states that a Regent may only be appointed if government if incapacitated, or during the succession procedures. Arcadia maintains that it's government is functioning normally, and is not in any respect incapacitated, making the claims made by the Imperial Throne invalid, and unlawful.    
        <p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, multiple clauses in the Treaty of Eternal Union forbid the unilateral exercising of emergency powers over either signiatories, further invalidating the actions of the Throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a direct statement to the Empire, His Lordship the Lord High King of Arcadia declared:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Arcadia shall not yield to unconstitutional impositions masked as emergency measures. The Empire’s declaration is unlawful in Arcadia, and it shall be treated as such."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The proposed regency, announced without consultation, consent, or legal basis, constitutes an overt act of overreach and a breach of the Treaty’s core articles, specifically Article XV regarding emergency protocol and Article IV on mutual recognition of sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord High King’s Council has issued a formal refusal of recognition and instructed all civil and military bodies to ignore and nullify all directives from the claimed regency. Any interference by foreign-appointed officers will be treated as hostile and repelled accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arcadia remains committed to lawful union, but not at the cost of its liberty. Should the Gheetan Empire proceed further down this unlawful path, it will bear sole responsibility for the unraveling of the alliance.
        </p>
