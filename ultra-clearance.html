        <h2>üîê Strategic Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Preservation of Arcadian independence at all levels.</li>
            <li>Detection and neutralization of subversive foreign influence.</li>
            <li>Covert diplomatic operations in aligned and neutral territories.</li>

  <h2>Government Continuity Protocols</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Activation codes and contingencies for government continuity during crisis scenarios include the following:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Protocol Aegis:</strong> Initiated upon confirmed incapacitation of central leadership. Empowers regional governors to assume executive functions under oath-bound guidance of the Constitution of Arcadia.</li>
    <li><strong>Activation Code Omega-9:</strong> Triggers secure communication networks and encrypted satellite channels for uninterrupted inter-governmental coordination.</li>
    <li><strong>Directive Nightglass:</strong> Automatically mobilizes loyalist forces to protect key infrastructure and preserve national archives in fortified vaults.</li>
    <li><strong>Shadow Protocol:</strong> Engages the Arcadian Emergency Council, allowing rapid deployment of classified assets and invoking temporary suspension of non-critical operations for national focus.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuity Beacon System:</strong> Broadcasts encrypted fail-safe codes to all provincial leadership centers to synchronize emergency authority structures and ensure lawful succession.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These protocols are reviewed bi-annually by the High Council and are designed to preserve the sovereignty, leadership integrity, and operational continuity of the Kingdom of Arcadia under extreme duress.
