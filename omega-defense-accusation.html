      <h2>Arcadia Denies Gheetan Accusation Over Protocol Omega</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">June 4, 2025 – Royal Capital, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        The High Crown of Arcadia has issued an official denial in response to accusations from the Great Gheetan Empire claiming that <strong>Protocol Omega</strong> constitutes high treason and a breach of the Treaty of Eternal Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a statement released today, Arcadian officials firmly rejected the claim, clarifying that Protocol Omega was a <em>classified, defensive contingency protocol</em> never enacted, never published, and never intended to be used unless the Kingdom Realm itself came under direct threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Arcadian legal authorities, the document was discovered and seized unlawfully during an imperial cyber intrusion—an act which itself constitutes a direct violation of Article IX of the Treaty of Eternal Union, which guarantees non-interference in sovereign infrastructure.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “It is not treason to prepare for the defense of one’s own country,” read a statement from the Office of the High King. “It is a crime, however, to break into a sovereign realm’s classified systems and then twist what you find to justify further aggression.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Arcadia has made public a list of documented treaty violations committed by the Gheetan Empire, including the attempted appointment of a regent, seizure of confidential defense materials, issuance of an illegal arrest warrant, and refusal to recognize Arcadian sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gheetan’s legal claim that Arcadia remains a “subject realm” has been dismissed by the Arcadian government as both false and colonial in tone. In a separate statement, the High King reaffirmed Arcadia’s formal withdrawal from the Treaty and full restoration of sovereign independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arcadia’s international partners have been notified of the ongoing crisis, and neutral states are being urged to recognize the Kingdom Realm’s legal position.
