      <h2>Arcadia and Gavonian Isles Sign Defence Agreement</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">June 4, 2025 –(REDACTED FOR SECURITY)</p>
      <p>
        In a bold act of mutual solidarity, the Kingdom of Arcadia and the Territory of the Gavonian Isles have signed a Treaty of Mutual Defence and Strategic Cooperation. The agreement was finalized earlier today in an undisclosed neutral territory and signifies a major shift in regional security dynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The treaty commits both parties to the principle of collective defense and includes provisions for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Joint military readiness and rapid response coordination</li>
        <li>Expanded naval and aerial operations across shared waters</li>
        <li>Secure communications and intelligence-sharing protocols</li>
        <li>Protection of sovereign territories from foreign interference</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        High King Mark Blakney hailed the agreement as “a necessary and timely reaffirmation of Arcadia’s micronational leadership,” stating, “No power—imperial or otherwise—shall dictate the affairs of sovereign peoples. This alliance is a shield against aggression and a vow between brothers.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Governor-General Gavin Jones echoed this sentiment, calling the alliance “a partnership rooted in principle, not submission.” The Governor-General praised Arcadia for its quick action in this treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new treaty is expected to take immediate effect, with defense coordination measures already underway. Arcadian and Gavonian forces will conduct their first joint naval patrols later this month.
