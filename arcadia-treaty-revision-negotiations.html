      <h2>Arcadia Seeks Greater Autonomy in Treaty Revisions</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 20, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        The Kingdom of Arcadia has formally entered negotiations with the Great Gheetan Empire regarding amendments to the Treaty of Eternal Union. The discussions, which are being held in a spirit of unity and mutual respect, aim to provide Arcadia with greater self-governance while maintaining a strong alliance with the Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lord High King emphasized that Arcadia remains committed to peace and cooperation with the Empire, but must ensure sovereign control over its internal governance and symbolic representation in foreign affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arcadia is respectfully requesting the following changes to the treaty:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomy in Domestic Affairs</strong> – Complete control over internal laws, leadership, policy, and governance with less Imperial oversight.</li>
        <li><strong>Symbolic Foreign Representation</strong> – Ability to engage in ceremonial or symbolic diplomatic acts with Imperial knowledge but without requiring pre-approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural and Legal Independence</strong> – Authority to set its own cultural, religious, and judicial standards within Arcadian territory.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Communications</strong> – Right to make public statements on foreign issues, provided they align with Imperial policy or are symbolic in nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Domestic Sovereignty</strong> – The Emperor may not suspend Arcadian internal operations during foreign crises without consultation.</li>
        <li><strong>Representation in Intermicronational Affairs</strong> – Arcadia requests the right to bring representation to any intermiconational affairs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
  Arcadia is confident that most, if not all, proposed terms will be accepted by the Empire. Additionally, Arcadia has expressed interest in securing liberty in trade and diplomatic affairs, including the ability to negotiate with other micronations under a framework of mutual respect and non-interference.
</p>
      <p>
        The Lord High King concluded the statement by saying, “Arcadia does not seek separation, but true partnership. Sovereignty within unity.”
