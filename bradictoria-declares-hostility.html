        <h2>Bradictoria Declares Arcadia an Enemy of the Empire</h2>
        <p class="timestamp">June 6, 2025</p>
        <p>
          In a fiery decree issued earlier today, the Emperor of Bradictoria has formally declared the Kingdom of Arcadia an enemy of the Empire, condemning what he calls an "outrageous and unlawful proclamation" from the Arcadian Crown. The document, known as <em>Imperial Decree No. IX</em>, outlines the Empire's full rejection of Arcadian authority and marks the complete breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two micronations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decree accuses Arcadia of seeking to impose “totalitarian control” over Bradictorian institutions, calling it “an insult not only to the dignity of the Empire but to the very foundation of self-governance.” The Emperor denounced the Arcadian stance as a “hostile attempt to dissolve Bradictorian autonomy.”
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “We will not have any more of this foolishness. The Empire of Bradictoria stands firm. Let no one mistake our silence for submission.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The document enacts four sweeping measures:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Formal Rejection</strong> of all Arcadian claims to supremacy;</li>
            <li><strong>Termination of Diplomatic Relations</strong> with Arcadia;</li>
            <li><strong>Official Declaration of Hostility</strong>, placing Arcadia in the status of an enemy;</li>
            <li><strong>A National Unity Directive</strong>, rallying Bradictorians to reject “submission.”</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arcadian Crown has not yet responded to the decree, though military analysts confirm that defensive protocols were already underway following earlier provocations. Regional observers note that this marks a sharp escalation in what was previously a cold standoff between the Kingdom of Arcadia, the Gavonion Isles, and the Empire of Bradictoria.
