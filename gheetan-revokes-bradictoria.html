      <h2>Gheetan Empire Revokes All Recognition of Bradictoria</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 16, 2025 ‚Äì Imperial Palace, Gheetan</p>
      <p>
        In a decisive imperial decree issued earlier today, the Great Gheetan Empire has formally and irrevocably revoked all recognition of the self-declared State of Bradictoria. The pronouncement, signed by His Imperial Majesty, was broadcast across the Realms in what has been described as the Empire‚Äôs ‚Äúfinal word‚Äù on Bradictoria.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>üìú IMPERIAL DECREE AND FINAL NOTICE REGARDING BRADICTORIA</strong><br>
        ‚ÄúLet it be known across the Realms and to all observing foreign bodies,‚Äù the decree began. ‚ÄúThe Great Gheetan Empire, in all its sovereignty, unity, and dignity, formally and finally severs all contact, recognition, and regard for the self-proclaimed State of Bradictoria.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        The Emperor cited years of betrayal, provocation, and hollow symbolism as the basis for the decision, asserting that Bradictoria has failed to uphold the responsibilities of a legitimate nation. A detailed comparison followed:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>Bradictoria</th>
            <th>Great Gheetan Empire</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Territory</td>
            <td>1 private property, no legal status</td>
            <td>4,261.5 m¬≤ of documented, governed territory</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Citizenship</td>
            <td>2 individuals</td>
            <td>11 recognized citizens with ID and services</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Government Structure</td>
            <td>Symbolic 'tripartite', no legal basis</td>
            <td>Constitutional monarchy with functioning law</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Diplomacy</td>
            <td>No recognition, few relations</td>
            <td>Active international diplomatic engagement</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúWhat they call governance, we call theatre. What they call legitimacy, we demonstrate with action,‚Äù the Emperor declared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Empire further accused Bradictoria of rejecting diplomacy, spreading disinformation, and attempting to mask weakness with bravado. ‚ÄúWe once guided Bradictoria. Their response: condemnation, denial, and betrayal cloaked in self-importance.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        The decree ends with finality: ‚ÄúNo recognition shall henceforth or ever again be extended to Bradictoria by the Great Gheetan Empire or any of its Realms. Their declaration of finality is accepted. And in that finality, we find clarity.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúLet history record that Gheetan led with patience. And Bradictoria chose pride over growth.‚Äù
