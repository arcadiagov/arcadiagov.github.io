      <h2>Mr. Steeves Attacks Lord High King and Emperor of Gheetan</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 21, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        In a shocking escalation of hostilities, Lennox Steeves, Minister of Online Security of Bradictoria, violently attacked His Lordship, the Lord High King of Arcadia, as well as the Emperor of the Great Gheetan Empire, during a joint diplomatic summit today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eyewitnesses report that Steeves not only physically assaulted both sovereigns but also verbally threatened to murder and assassinate them, sparking immediate security intervention and a lockdown of the summit venue.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Royal Security Forces have detained Steeves and launched an official investigation into the incident. Arcadian and Gheetan authorities have jointly condemned the attack and the threats, declaring the actions as an unprecedented breach of diplomatic protocol and a direct threat to the sovereignty of both realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Lordship and the Emperor of Gheetan are reported to be unharmed but deeply shaken by the aggression. Emergency security measures have been increased to protect both leaders and ensure the continuation of diplomatic relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Officials emphasize that this violent act will not deter the Kingdom of Arcadia and the Great Gheetan Empire from pursuing peace and stability, but that the perpetrators will face the full force of the law.
