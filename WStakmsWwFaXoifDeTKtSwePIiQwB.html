    <p>
      The Arcadian Penal Code is established to maintain order, uphold the integrity of the Kingdom, and safeguard the sovereignty and security of the Lord High King and the realm. It defines criminal acts, outlines punishments, and ensures justice for all citizens, from the highest nobility to the common people. In particular, crimes of treason, high treason, and imperial treason are regarded as the gravest offenses against the Kingdom, its monarchy, and its security.
