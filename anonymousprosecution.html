      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-200">
        <li>Intent does not negate unauthorized system breach—good intentions are irrelevant under RAMP Cyber Protocol 9.4.</li>
        <li>System “upgrades” made post-incident do not absolve prior criminal acts. This is mitigation, not exoneration.</li>
        <li>No ethical hacker registry exists; unauthorized intrusion cannot be post-labeled as ethical without pre-clearance.</li>
        <li>Defense fails to provide independent verification of Steeves’s stated purpose or intent.</li>

        <li>Leverage digital forensics to show repeated and deliberate unauthorized access patterns.</li>
        <li>Use testimony from internal IT officers showing no request, contact, or attempted clearance by Steeves.</li>
        <li>Frame the act as part of a larger pattern of techno-vigilantism which undermines legal process.</li>
        <li>Undercut the narrative of "ethical hacking" by citing international norms and Arcadian case law.</li>

          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Opening Statement (58s)</h4>
          <p>Members of the tribunal, this is not a case of curiosity gone too far. It is about accountability in a digital age. Mr. Steeves did not ask permission, he did not report his findings, and he bypassed layers of classified infrastructure with full knowledge of its protected status. This is not vigilance—it’s vigilantism.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Rebuttal to "Good Intent" (47s)</h4>
          <p>Good intentions are not a defense in Arcadian law. If they were, any citizen could justify breaching nuclear codes to “test” them. We do not criminalize intent alone, but we absolutely prosecute actions. This was a deliberate, repeated incursion into a protected zone.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Closing Remarks (59s)</h4>
          <p>You have heard the defense speak of hope, but justice is not about hope—it is about law. Mr. Steeves’s actions broke that law. No title, no goal, no claimed ethic can excuse a breach of the sovereign security network. Find him accountable, not because he is evil—but because the law was broken, and we are a nation of laws.</p>
