            <h2>Preamble</h2>
            <p>
                The Penal Code of Bradictoria is established to maintain order, uphold the integrity of the Empire, and safeguard the sovereignty and security of the Emperor and the realm. It defines criminal acts, outlines punishments, and ensures justice for all citizens. Crimes of treason, high treason, and imperial treason are regarded as the gravest offenses against the Empire, its sovereignty, and its supreme ruler, the Emperor.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Supreme Authority Clause:</strong> In all legal, criminal, or judicial matters concerning this Code, the Emperor shall possess supreme authority to interpret, override, or declare any action or omission to be lawful or unlawful, regardless of prior articles herein. His Majesty’s word on any criminal classification shall carry the full force of law.

    <h2>Chapter 2: Treason</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Article 4:</strong> Definition of Treason</p>
    <p>Treason shall be defined as any deliberate, unlawful act committed by a citizen, subject, or resident of the Empire of Bradictoria that constitutes a betrayal of the sacred loyalty and allegiance owed to the Emperor and the Imperial Realm. Such acts include, but are not limited to, attempts to overthrow the lawful government, endanger the Emperor’s life or authority, or diminish the Empire’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, national security, or global standing. Furthermore, any act or omission deemed treasonous by Imperial Decree shall be recognized as such, as the Emperor retains absolute authority to define treason in accordance with divine and imperial law.</p>

    <p><strong>Article 5:</strong> Acts Constituting Treason</p>
    <p>The following actions, when committed with intent to harm the Empire or undermine its sovereign authority, shall be deemed treasonous under Imperial Law:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Espionage</strong> — The act of gathering, transmitting, or attempting to acquire sensitive or classified information on behalf of a hostile nation, foreign power, or adversarial entity, with the intent to injure the Empire or advantage a foreign interest.</li>

        <li><strong>Assassination Plot</strong> — Conspiring to cause harm to, attempt to assassinate, or succeed in the assassination of the Emperor, members of the Imperial Family, or any high-ranking government officials appointed by Imperial Authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Subversion</strong> — Disseminating seditious propaganda, inciting civil disobedience, or conducting covert operations designed to delegitimize the Empire’s institutions, sow discord among its citizens, or bring contempt upon the Throne.</li>
        <li><strong>Aid to the Enemy</strong> — Offering material, financial, logistical, or strategic assistance—either directly or indirectly—to any nation, group, insurgency, or militant force recognized by the Empire as hostile or in a state of war with Bradictoria.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Article 6:</strong> Penalties for Treason</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Death</strong> — The sentence of death shall be imposed for acts of treason resulting in the death, attempted assassination, or grievous harm inflicted upon the Emperor, the Imperial Family, or senior state officials. Execution shall be carried out in a manner deemed just by the Emperor or His appointed magistrates.</li>
        <li><strong>Life Imprisonment</strong> — Perpetrators found guilty of espionage, organized rebellion, or prolonged acts of sabotage may be sentenced to life imprisonment within a high-security Imperial Correctional Fortress, without possibility of parole or pardon unless granted directly by the Emperor.</li>
        <li><strong>Confiscation of Property</strong> — Any estate, land, title, financial assets, or material wealth acquired or employed in service of treason shall be seized by the Imperial Treasury and redistributed or repurposed as the Emperor sees fit.

    <h2>Chapter 3: High Treason</h2>

    <p><strong>Article 7:</strong> Definition of High Treason</p>
    <p>High Treason is the gravest of all offenses under Imperial Law, encompassing acts that seek to destroy, dethrone, betray, or otherwise imperil the Emperor, the Imperial Household, the Sovereign Government, or the very existence and integrity of the Empire of Bradictoria. It includes any attempt—whether by force, conspiracy, sedition, or foreign alliance—to subvert the Emperor’s rule, alter the structure of Imperial governance without lawful sanction, or diminish the authority vested in the Crown by divine right and tradition. His Imperial Majesty reserves the eternal right to define or expand this designation by Imperial Decree, and no mortal law may override such proclamation.</p>

    <p><strong>Article 8:</strong> Acts Constituting High Treason</p>
    <p>The following acts, whether successful or attempted, shall be deemed High Treason and prosecuted with utmost severity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Assassination Attempt</strong> — Any effort, plan, or conspiracy to cause the death or grievous harm of the Emperor, the Empress, heirs to the Throne, or senior members of the Imperial Household, by any means direct or indirect.</li>
        <li><strong>Military Coup</strong> — Seizing, attempting to seize, or inciting rebellion within the Imperial Armed Forces, including unauthorized mobilization, mutiny, or use of force against loyalist units or institutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Secession or Partition</strong> — Leading, funding, or supporting any regional, ethnic, political, or religious movement seeking independence, separation, or autonomy from the unified and indivisible Empire of Bradictoria.</li>
        <li><strong>Collusion with Foreign Powers</strong> — Engaging in espionage, diplomacy, or military cooperation with any foreign sovereign, hostile faction, or rival empire to the detriment of Bradictoria’s sovereignty, defense, or territorial integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Attempted Usurpation</strong> — Declaring oneself ruler, emperor, regent, or head of state without lawful succession, coronation, or investiture under Imperial Law.</li>
        <li><strong>Desecration of the Imperial Seal</strong> — Forging, stealing, misusing, or defiling the official symbols, banners, or emblems of the Crown for treasonous or deceitful purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Sabotage of Imperial Institutions</strong> — The deliberate destruction or impairment of palaces, fortresses, treasuries, or vital organs of the State for the purpose of destabilization or rebellion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Article 9:</strong> Penalties for High Treason</p>
    <p>Given the mortal threat High Treason poses to the continuity of the Empire and the sacred person of His Imperial Majesty, penalties shall be absolute, ceremonial, and beyond appeal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capital Punishment</strong> — Execution by a method deemed symbolically appropriate by the Emperor, such as beheading, hanging, or dismemberment, shall be carried out with public solemnity to deter others. Execution shall be swift, final, and witnessed by Imperial officials.</li>
        <li><strong>Confiscation of Property and Titles</strong> — The entirety of the traitor’s estates, wealth, and noble or civil titles shall be forfeit to the Imperial Treasury, to be reassigned to loyal subjects as deemed fit by the Crown.</li>
        <li><strong>Erasure from Record</strong> — The traitor’s name may, by decree, be struck from all public records, family trees, and monuments. No tombstone shall bear their name. Their legacy shall be declared null in the eyes of history.</li>
        <li><strong>Punishment of Conspirators</strong> — All accomplices, enablers, and beneficiaries of the traitor’s plans, including family members aware of the plot, may be tried under this Chapter and receive equal or lesser punishment as the Imperial Tribunal shall determine.</li>
        <li><strong>Posthumous Retribution</strong> — Should High Treason be discovered after the death of the perpetrator, the Empire reserves the right to confiscate any inherited property, disinter and dishonor remains, and deny the family future titles or positions of trust.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Imperial Agents Abroad</strong> — Authorized agents of the Empire may be dispatched beyond Bradictorian territory to collect evidence, protect witnesses, or execute operations essential to Imperial justice, with or without the consent of local authorities depending on the threat level.</li>
        <li><strong>Diplomatic Enforcement</strong> — Enforcement through diplomatic pressure, sanctions, or formal demands shall be coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Enforcement in service of Imperial Law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Article 39:</strong> Limitations and Immunities</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction shall respect the sovereignty of other recognized states, except where such states are deemed hostile, unrecognized, or in breach of imperial agreements.
