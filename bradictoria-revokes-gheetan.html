        <h2>Bradictoria Revokes All Recognition of Arcadia and Gheetan</h2>
        <p class="timestamp">May 16, 2025 ‚Äì Port Grandhall, Bradictoria</p>
        <p>
          In a dramatic and unprecedented diplomatic rupture, the Government of Bradictoria has formally revoked all recognition of both the Kingdom of Arcadia and the Great Gheetan Empire. The decision was announced in a letter signed by Emperor Bradley Mathieu Christie and delivered through official channels earlier today.
        </p>
        <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è OFFICIAL NOTICE FROM THE EMPEROR OF BRADICTORIA</strong><br>
          This letter serves as an official and final declaration from the Government of Bradictoria regarding your actions and status in relation to our sovereign state.
        </p>
        <p>
          After careful review and documentation of repeated offenses‚Äîranging from unlawful conduct and diplomatic sabotage to the unauthorized disclosure of classified military documents‚ÄîBradictoria hereby revokes all recognition of any authority claimed by Arcadia or Gheetan.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúThe final and unforgivable breach occurred with the unauthorized release of confidential Bradictorian war plans,‚Äù the letter states. ‚ÄúThis constitutes an act of gross misconduct and treachery. Effective immediately:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>üìõ All diplomatic ties are severed.</li>
          <li>‚ùå All recognition of your self-proclaimed governments is null and void.</li>
          <li>üìµ No further communication will be acknowledged unless it begins with a full and formal apology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The message, signed by Emperor Christie, continues: ‚ÄúAny further actions committed against the State of Bradictoria, its government, or its people will be interpreted as acts of aggression and will be treated accordingly ‚Äî as acts of war.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          He concludes with a chilling warning: ‚ÄúDo not attempt to contact this government unless you are prepared to issue a complete and sincere apology. Until such time, your names and actions are recorded in the archives of dishonor.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          This move effectively ends all diplomatic recognition between Bradictoria and its former partners, escalating tensions to their highest point since the initiation of CODE PURPLE STORM.
