      <h2>State of Emergency Declared in Arcadia</h2>
      <p><em>April 30, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</em></p>
      <p>
        The Kingdom of Arcadia has officially entered a nationwide state of emergency following credible threats posed by an unnamed terrorist entity. The Lord High King has issued an executive decree to mobilize national security forces, elevate defensive readiness, and tighten digital and physical infrastructure protections across all provinces.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This is a moment of great vigilance,” said the Lord High King during an emergency address to the High Council. “We face a grave, though shadowed, threat to the peace and stability of our Kingdom. Let it be known that Arcadia shall never yield to fear, nor falter in the face of those who would see our sovereignty undone.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizens are urged to remain calm and report any suspicious behavior or activity to their local authorities. The Ministry of Defense has assured the public that all critical systems, including royal infrastructure and communications networks, remain under strict protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The identity of the terrorist actor has not been disclosed at this time due to ongoing intelligence operations. Investigations are being conducted in collaboration with the Royal Guard, the Arcadian Intelligence Agency, and allied cyber defense units.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a developing story. Further updates will be provided as official statements and security briefings are released.
