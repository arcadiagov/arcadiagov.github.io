        <h1>🛡️ Treaty Exit Strategy and Sovereignty Assertion</h1>

        <h2>📜 Declaration of Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
            We, the representatives of the Kingdom of Arcadia, declare the unilateral and irrevocable withdrawal from the Treaty of Eternal Union. 
            The Kingdom of Arcadia henceforth exercises full sovereign authority, political independence, and strategic autonomy in all realms of governance.
        </p>

        <h2>🚫 Non-Recognition of Gheetan Authority</h2>
        <p>
            All organs, officials, and institutions of the Great Gheetan Empire are henceforth considered foreign entities without authority over Arcadian affairs. 
            Any imposition of will by Gheetan agents will be treated as hostile interference.
        </p>

        <h2>📣 Address to the High Council</h2>
        <p>
            Esteemed Councilors,
            <br>
            In defense of Arcadia’s founding principles and sacred sovereignty, I inform you that the Kingdom has severed all ties with the Great Gheetan Empire.
            All council members are to affirm loyalty to Arcadia’s independence and uphold this new path of freedom and unity.
        </p>

        <h2>🤝 Communication to Allied Nations</h2>
        <p>
            Allies and Friends of Arcadia,
            <br>
            With solemn resolve, we announce our independence from the Gheetan Empire. We remain committed to peaceful cooperation, regional stability, and shared prosperity.
            We call upon your support in defending our liberty and recognizing our sovereign status.
        </p>

        <h2>⚔️ Formal Declaration of War Against Gheetan</h2>
        <p>
            Let it be known: the Kingdom of Arcadia declares a state of war against the Great Gheetan Empire in response to its violations of our sovereignty and encroachments upon our autonomy.
            This declaration shall stand until the full restoration of Arcadian independence and territorial integrity.
        </p>

        <h2>🪖 Loyalist Mobilization Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Activate all regional command centers and place forces on highest alert.</li>
            <li>Deploy the Royal Guard to strategic chokepoints and national archives.</li>
            <li>Secure all communication and transportation hubs.</li>
            <li>Neutralize foreign agents and protect civilian infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Initiate Operation Iron Resolve: coordinated defense maneuvers across all loyal provinces.</li>
        </ul>
