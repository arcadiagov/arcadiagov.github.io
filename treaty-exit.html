        <h1>üõ°Ô∏è Treaty Exit Strategy and Sovereignty Assertion</h1>

        <h2>üìú Declaration of Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
            We, the representatives of the Kingdom of Arcadia, declare the unilateral and irrevocable withdrawal from the Treaty of Eternal Union. 
            The Kingdom of Arcadia henceforth exercises full sovereign authority, political independence, and strategic autonomy in all realms of governance.
        </p>

        <h2>üö´ Non-Recognition of Gheetan Authority</h2>
        <p>
            All organs, officials, and institutions of the Great Gheetan Empire are henceforth considered foreign entities without authority over Arcadian affairs. 
            Any imposition of will by Gheetan agents will be treated as hostile interference.
        </p>

        <h2>üì£ Address to the High Council</h2>
        <p>
            Esteemed Councilors,
            <br>
            In defense of Arcadia‚Äôs founding principles and sacred sovereignty, I inform you that the Kingdom has severed all ties with the Great Gheetan Empire.
            All council members are to affirm loyalty to Arcadia‚Äôs independence and uphold this new path of freedom and unity.OFFICIAL ADDRESS TO THE HIGH COUNCIL AND ALLIED NATIONS

Kingdom of Arcadia
Office of the Lord High King

Date: [Insert Date]

To the Esteemed Members of the High Council of Arcadia and Our Honored Allies,

It is with a solemn sense of duty and a heavy heart that I address you today regarding a matter of the utmost importance to the future of our Kingdom and our relationships with those who stand with us. After considerable reflection, deliberation, and in light of the recent actions of the Great Gheetan Empire, it has become abundantly clear that our continued association with the Empire is no longer tenable.

For years, Arcadia has upheld its commitment to the Treaty of Eternal Union with the Gheetan Empire. We have honored our obligations with diligence, seeking peace and cooperation for the prosperity of our people and the security of our realm. However, it is with deep regret that I must announce that Arcadia is formally severing all ties with the Great Gheetan Empire and leaving the Treaty of Eternal Union.

This decision has not been made lightly. It follows a long period of increasingly aggressive actions, diplomatic manipulations, and the undermining of our sovereignty by the Gheetan Empire. Despite our repeated efforts to maintain peace and honor the treaties that bind us, the Empire's actions have become incompatible with our values, our Constitution, and our national security. Their relentless encroachments on our rights as a sovereign nation have left us with no recourse but to take this drastic step in order to protect the future of our Kingdom and the integrity of Arcadian autonomy.

To the High Council, know that this decision is taken in full consideration of our Constitutional duty to preserve the liberty and independence of our people. Our decision is grounded in our unshakable commitment to Arcadia‚Äôs sovereignty, which is non-negotiable. The Gheetan Empire‚Äôs imposition of their will upon our people is an affront to all that we stand for. It is a threat that we can no longer allow to persist.

To our allies and partners across the continent, I call upon you to stand with us in this defining moment. Arcadia is no longer bound by the dictates of the Gheetan Empire. We are free to chart our own course, to defend our lands, and to secure our future. We are determined to ensure the survival and thriving of Arcadia, and we will do so with honor, courage, and determination.

The road ahead will undoubtedly be fraught with challenges, but I am confident that together, as a united force, we will overcome them. The Kingdom of Arcadia remains open to all allies who share our values of liberty, peace, and cooperation. The departure from Gheetan is not a rejection of all alliances, but a reaffirmation of our desire to forge new paths based on mutual respect and the preservation of our sovereignty.

Let this be known: Arcadia is a Kingdom of strength, and we will not bow to external pressure. We are a Kingdom that stands proudly on its own, and we will rise to defend our people, our culture, and our future.

May the High Council remain steadfast in its wisdom, and may our allies support us in this pivotal moment.
        </p>

        <h2>ü§ù Communication to Allied Nations</h2>
        <p>
            Allies and Friends of Arcadia,
            <br>
            With solemn resolve, we announce our independence from the Gheetan Empire. We remain committed to peaceful cooperation, regional stability, and shared prosperity.
            We call upon your support in defending our liberty and recognizing our sovereign status.
        </p>

        <h2>‚öîÔ∏è Formal Declaration of War Against Gheetan</h2>
        <p>
            Let it be known: the Kingdom of Arcadia declares a state of war against the Great Gheetan Empire in response to its violations of our sovereignty and encroachments upon our autonomy.
            This declaration shall stand until the full restoration of Arcadian independence and territorial integrity.OFFICIAL WAR DECLARATION

Kingdom of Arcadia
Office of the Lord High King

Date: [Insert Date]

To the Esteemed Leaders of the Great Gheetan Empire,

We, the people and Sovereign of the Kingdom of Arcadia, under the authority granted by the Constitution of Arcadia and in fulfillment of our sacred duty to preserve the integrity and autonomy of our realm, hereby issue this formal declaration of war against the Great Gheetan Empire, effective immediately.

The actions and policies of the Great Gheetan Empire, including but not limited to the repeated violations of Arcadian sovereignty, the infringement of our territorial integrity, and the unprovoked aggression exhibited towards our allies and the free peoples of the continent, have left us no choice but to respond with force.

Despite numerous diplomatic efforts to resolve our differences and preserve the peace, the Great Gheetan Empire has continued to encroach upon the rights and freedoms of Arcadia. Their actions threaten not only the future of our Kingdom, but also the stability and security of the entire region.

As of this moment, the Kingdom of Arcadia formally recognizes the state of hostilities between our two nations. All citizens of Arcadia are hereby called upon to rally in defense of their homeland, and all loyalist military forces are ordered to proceed with immediate mobilization for defensive and offensive operations as outlined in our emergency protocols.

This war, initiated by the Gheetan Empire's unjust aggression, will be fought until the sovereignty of Arcadia is fully restored, the threat of imperial overreach eradicated, and peace and security returned to our land.

May our cause be just, our resolve unwavering, and our victory assured.
        </p>
