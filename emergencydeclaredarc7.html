      <h2>International State of Emergency Declared — ARC-7 Alert Activated</h2>
      <p><em>May 1, 2025 – Capital City, the Kingdom of Arcadia</em></p>

      <p>
        By Royal Decree of the Lord High King, the Kingdom of Arcadia has entered an
        <strong>international state of emergency</strong> and activated an
        <strong>ARC-7 level alert</strong> following the escalation of a severe and ongoing threat
        originating beyond national borders.
      </p>

      <p>
        The declaration authorizes expanded defensive coordination with allied states,
        full activation of royal intelligence assets, and heightened readiness across all
        military, cyber, and diplomatic sectors. Border security, communications monitoring,
        and judicial cooperation mechanisms have been immediately reinforced.
      </p>

      <p>
        In an emergency session of the High Council, the Lord High King stated:
        <br><br>
        “This measure is not taken lightly. The threat before us is persistent, evasive,
        and international in scope. Arcadia will act decisively to protect its people,
        its institutions, and the sanctity of the Crown.”
      </p>

      <p>
        While specific operational details remain classified, officials confirmed that the
        alert was triggered by actions attributed to a single external actor whose conduct
        has crossed multiple legal and sovereign thresholds. Disclosure of identity has been
        withheld to preserve active intelligence operations and international legal processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Citizens of the Kingdom are urged to remain calm and vigilant. Any suspicious activity,
        disinformation efforts, or attempts to interfere with judicial or governmental functions
        should be reported immediately to local authorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Ministry of Sovereignty and the Royal Guard have assured the public that all critical
        infrastructure and royal systems remain secure under enhanced protection protocols.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a developing situation. Further official updates will be issued as conditions
        evolve and additional determinations are made by the Crown and the High Council.
      </p>
