      <h2>Gheetan Empire Introduces Jediism as Official Spiritual Order</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 19, 2025 – Imperial Capital, Gheetan</p>
      <p>
        In a groundbreaking development within the Great Gheetan Empire, His Imperial Majesty has proclaimed the official founding of the <strong>United Jedi Church of Gheetan (U.J.C.G.)</strong>. This spiritual institution is dedicated to the living Force, the Jedi Code, and the principles of peace, wisdom, and harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church, enshrined by imperial charter, defines Jediism not as fiction but as a legitimate philosophical and spiritual path. Its founding documents assert: “The Force is a real, living energy present in all things,” and uphold a sacred commitment to compassion, mindfulness, and service to the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Emperor himself serves as the <em>Imperial Jedi Master</em>—the Supreme Head of the Church—and oversees the newly established <strong>High Council of the Force</strong>, a spiritual body without temporal authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members of the Church are bound to the Jedi Code:
        <blockquote>
          There is no emotion, there is peace.<br>
          There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.<br>
          There is no passion, there is serenity.<br>
          There is no chaos, there is harmony.<br>
          There is no death, there is the Force.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        The charter also outlines a structured hierarchy that includes Jedi Initiates, Knights, Masters, and High Council Members. A distinctive feature is the <strong>Lightsaber Requirement</strong>: all Knights or higher must possess and maintain a lightsaber, seen not as a weapon but a symbol of spiritual dedication and peacekeeping.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church’s founding document further provides guidance on meditation, conduct, service, and a daily spiritual routine for followers. It establishes a strong moral code emphasizing compassion, humility, and balance. Violations such as abuse of power or igniting a lightsaber in rage are strictly prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Through Discipline, Peace. Through Peace, Harmony. Through Harmony, the Force,” states the Church's Manual of Study and Conduct, offering a blueprint for spiritual life within the Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lightsaber of the reigning Emperor is now recognized by Imperial Decree as the <strong>Imperial Weapon of the Empire</strong>, a sacred symbol of divine rule and unity. Local lords may similarly designate their own <strong>Weapons of the Realm</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kingdom of Arcadia has acknowledged the development with respectful curiosity, though no formal diplomatic statement has yet been issued.
      </p>
      <p>
        The United Jedi Church of Gheetan now joins the annals of recognized spiritual institutions within the Empire, heralding a new age of philosophy, discipline, and galactic resonance.
