  <div class="to-leaders">
    <p>To: Emperor Holden Porter (Great Gheetan Empire), Emperor Bradley Christie (Bradectoria)</p>
    <p>From: Ministry of Intelligence and Sovereign Affairs — Kingdom Realm of Arcadia</p>

  <h3>⚠️ Gavin Jones⚠️</h3>
      <div class="profile-section blinking"><strong>HIGH IMPORTANCE</strong></div>
  <p><span class="label">Status:</span> Fugitive — Arrest Warrant Issued for High Treason</p>
  <p><span class="label">Known Aliases:</span> “His Royal and Imperial Majesty, Sovereign Ruler of the Sunlit Realms, Most Exalted and Glorious Emperor of the Gavonion Isles...” <em>(self-declared; abridged)</em></p>
  <p><span class="label">Crimes:</span> High Treason (T01), Usurpation of Foreign Authority (P17), Unauthorized Assumption of Title (P18), Sedition and Destabilization of State Order (S05), Attempted Coercion of the Crown (R03), Offence Against the Lordly Dignity (R01), Impersonation of Government Office (F08), Fabrication of a Foreign State Entity (S09), Symbolic Defilement of National Honor (R07), Aiding and Abetting High Treason (T02 — applicable to all collaborators).</p>
  <p><span class="label">Remarks:</span> Gavin Jones has undertaken hostile and delusional political actions in violation of Arcadian law, including the fraudulent proclamation of a fictitious state and the issuance of an illegitimate, grandiose royal title. His symbolic and verbal assault on the Crown, combined with his attempt to coerce the Lord High King into recognition, constitutes an egregious breach of royal dignity and national integrity.</p>
  <p><span class="label">Declared Threat:</span> Jones's fabricated dominion, the so-called "Gavonion Isles," and all attempts to legitimize it, represent a direct symbolic and legal threat to the Realm. His propaganda materials and titles are regarded as fraudulent statecraft.</p>
  <p><span class="label">Response:</span> The subject is beyond the protection of Arcadian citizenship. Citizens and allies are ordered to avoid contact. Any attempt to harbor, assist, or recognize Gavin Jones or the "Gavonion Isles" shall be prosecuted as High Treason.</p>
  <p><span class="label">Legal Status:</span> An official arrest warrant was issued on May 26, 2025, at 16:18 hours. The warrant remains in effect until capture and judgment by the High Council. Gavin Jones is to be apprehended with immediate priority under Arcadian and Imperial law.</p>

  <p><span class="label">Remarks:</span> Boucher's actions constitute a breach of constitutional and imperial law. His behavior poses a direct threat to Arcadian sovereignty, allied diplomatic stability, and regional peace.</p>
  <p><span class="label">Warrant Notice:</span> An Arcadian High Warrant for immediate capture remains active. Entities harboring or aiding the fugitive will face prosecution under Arcadian and allied intermicronational law.</p>
  <p><span class="label">Imperial Review:</span> Case no longer under review — confirmed conviction. Awaiting possible escalation to the Intermicronational Tribunal for regional enforcement coordination.</p>

  <div class="email-block">[Suspected internal access attempts via obfuscated Arcadian administrative channels]</div>
  <p><span class="label">Crimes:</span> Unauthorized attempts to infiltrate Arcadian classified government systems, identified as part of a covert cyber-espionage operation. Actions triggered rapid response from the Arcadian Cyber Defense Division.</p>
