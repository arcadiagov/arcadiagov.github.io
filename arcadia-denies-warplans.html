        <h2>Official Statement: False Claims of War Plans</h2>
        <p class="timestamp">May 30, 2025</p>
        <p>
          The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia categorically denies the recent false claims circulated by the Empire of Bradictoria regarding so-called "war plans" allegedly uncovered through unauthorized access to Arcadian government networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alleged documents are entirely fabricated. No such plans exist within any official military, diplomatic, or security directive of the Kingdom. The claims made by Bradictoria, reportedly spearheaded by Minister of Online Security Lennox Steeves, constitute a blatant disinformation campaign designed to undermine the stability of intermicronational relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an official address, His Lordship the Lord High King of Arcadia issued the following public statement:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Let it be declared with utmost clarity: Arcadia has authored no war plans against Bradictoria or any other micronation. The so-called 'discovered documents' are crude forgeries. We are a realm of order, not deception. The Empire’s propaganda will not shake the Crown's resolve, nor will it force us into a war of shadows and lies."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Arcadian government has launched a full investigation into this cyber incident and is consulting with digital security experts to identify the extent of the Bradictorian intrusion and the origins of the falsified material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it be clearly stated: Arcadia stands for peace, transparency, and the sovereignty of all micronations. Any suggestion to the contrary is pure fabrication and will be treated as a hostile act of propaganda.
        </p>
        <p>
          We urge Bradictoria to cease its inflammatory rhetoric and to restore diplomatic decorum before further damage is done to regional stability.
        </p>
