      <h2>Bradictoria Lifts Contact Ban with Gheetan Empire Amid Conditional Diplomacy</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 19, 2025 ‚Äì Port Grandhall, Bradictoria</p>
      <p>
        In a carefully worded communiqu√© released earlier today, the Government of Bradictoria announced the formal lifting of its longstanding contact ban with the Great Gheetan Empire. This decision signals a shift in Bradictoria‚Äôs diplomatic posture, while also setting firm expectations for future engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>üìú OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF BRADICTORIA</strong><br>
        Re: Diplomatic Status with the Great Gheetan Empire<br>
        To the People of Bradictoria and the International Micronational Community:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Government of Bradictoria formally announces the lifting of the contact ban with the Great Gheetan Empire. This decision comes as part of our continued commitment to diplomacy, stability, and the long-term interest of the Bradictorian people.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this marks a notable step toward re-engagement, officials emphasized that normalization of relations is far from complete. ‚ÄúTalks remain ongoing, and while we recognize the importance of dialogue, we also affirm that true reconciliation cannot occur without accountability,‚Äù the statement reads.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bradictoria‚Äôs Conditions for Normalization:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>‚úâÔ∏è A formal apology from the Gheetan Empire addressing prior actions deemed harmful to Bradictorian sovereignty.</li>
          <li>‚öñÔ∏è A clear commitment to accountability for previous diplomatic transgressions.</li>
          <li>üïäÔ∏è Future adherence to standards of mutual respect and international conduct.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúBradictoria stands for peace‚Äîbut never at the expense of truth or justice,‚Äù the statement affirms. ‚ÄúWe will continue to represent our people's interests with resolve, dignity, and strength.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        The release concludes with a message of cautious optimism: ‚ÄúThough wounds remain unhealed, the door to peace is no longer closed. We await Gheetan‚Äôs response‚Äînot in haste, but in hope.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        Signed,<br>
        <strong>The Government of Bradictoria</strong><br>
