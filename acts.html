      <h2>Arcadian Heraldry Act of 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">Proclaimed on the Nineteenth Day of April, 2025</p>
      <p>
Let it be proclaimed, for all noble houses, cities, and loyal citizens of the Kingdom of
Arcadia, that the sacred traditions of heraldry, armory, and symbolic regalia are
henceforth formally regulated and enshrined in law by royal statute.
The symbols of Arcadia—its coats of arms, blazons, banners, sigils, and ceremonial
crests—are solemn representations of lineage, dignity, and allegiance to the realm
and the Crown. As such, these symbols shall fall under the watch and governance of
the High Council, who shall oversee their use, authorization, and lawful bearing in
accordance with the honor of the Kingdom.
No individual, house, guild, or institution shall bear or adopt heraldic insignia without
warrant from the Crown or recognition by the High Council. The unauthorized use,
falsification, or misappropriation of heraldic symbols shall be considered an offense
against the dignity and sovereignty of the realm. In cases of significant abuse, such
an act may constitute treason or high treason, and may be punished accordingly—
including banishment, forfeiture, imprisonment, or death, as justice demands.
The Royal Emblem of Arcadia, as depicted above, shall remain the sovereign symbol
of the kingdom, representing its unity, legacy, and the enduring authority of its
monarchy. Its use is strictly protected and reserved to those offices and persons
granted permission by the High King or the High Council.
Let this Act take full and immediate effect throughout all provinces and dominions of
the Kingdom of Arcadia.</p>

    <h2>Arcadia Royal Blade Act of 2025</h2>
    <p>Let it be declared by royal statute, under the seal and authority of His Lordship,
the Left-Honorable Lord High King of Arcadia, that the blade known by ancient
name as Sting, presently held in the royal armory and borne at state occasion
by the High King’s own hand, is henceforth recognized as an object of
sovereign distinction and national heritage.
The sword Sting is hereby established as Royal Property of the Crown of
Arcadia, inseparable from the dignity and authority of the High King’s Office.
Possession of the blade shall not, in itself, confer the title or privileges of the
High King, nor imply lawful succession thereto. Rather, it shall serve as a
symbolic extension of the royal office, its bearer acting only with such authority
as has been granted by law, custom, or royal command. The presence of Sting
shall signify the Crown’s enduring legacy and the sovereign unity of Arcadia,
regardless of who bears it.
Be it further enacted that any act of theft, unauthorized handling, concealment,
damage, defilement, or destruction of the sword Sting shall be deemed a high
act of treason against the Crown. Such an offense shall be tried under the laws
of royal justice and punished to the fullest extent permitted by Arcadian and
Imperial law.
This Act shalll take full effect as of this Nineteenth Day of April, in the Year of
Our Sovereign Lord 2025.</p>

      <h2>Arcadian Treason Act of 2025</h2>
      <p>Proclaimed on the Nineteenth Day of April, in the Year of Union Two Thousand and
Twenty-Five
This Act is established for the recognition, definition, and punishment of treason in all
its forms, as committed within the lands and jurisdictions of the Kingdom of Arcadia.
Three degrees of treason shall be recognized by the Crown: treason, high treason,
and imperial treason. Treason shall encompass acts of disloyalty or betrayal against
the governance of Arcadia, including sedition, espionage, unlawful rebellion, or willful
obstruction of royal authority. High treason shall mean any crime directly against the
Crown or the person and dignity of the Lord High King, such as attempted regicide,
usurpation, or leading insurrection. Imperial treason, distinct in kind, refers to
offenses that endanger the unity or integrity of the Eternal Union and the standing of
Arcadia within it; such cases shall be referred to the Emperor and the Imperial Court
for determination and judgment. The High King and the Emperor may each, within
their own domains, declare acts to be treasonous, and such definitions shall hold the
force of law.
Punishments for treason may include imprisonment, banishment, seizure of property,
fines of grave weight, or death, in accordance with the severity of the act and
judgment passed. High treason shall bear the heaviest penalties under Arcadian law,
while imperial treason, once declared, shall fall under the direct jurisdiction of the
Empire. All penalties may be mitigated or pardoned only by the Crown or, where
appropriate, by imperial grace.
Let this Act be recorded and upheld throughout all territories and dominions of
Arcadia, and be made known to all subjects, officers, and courts as a matter of solemn
law. This Act shall take effect immediately upon its proclamation.</p>

    <h2>Arcadian Flag Act of 2025</h2>
    <p class="timestamp">Proclaimed on the Nineteenth Day of April, 2025</p>
      <p> 
Let it be known to all citizens, provinces, and representatives of the Kingdom of
Arcadia, that the national flag of Arcadia, as depicted above, is hereby established as
the sole and sovereign standard of the realm.
The flag, bearing a noble cross argent upon a field of purple, with five crimson stars
representing the unity and eternal vigilance of the realm, shall stand as the highest
symbol of Arcadian identity, honor, and loyalty. It shall fly above all state buildings,
diplomatic missions, ships of the realm, and military standards, and shall be displayed
at all official ceremonies of the Crown and government.
Any desecration, defacement, unauthorized alteration, or misuse of the Arcadian flag
shall be deemed an act of disrespect against the Kingdom and its people. Such
offenses may, depending on the nature and intent, constitute treason or high treason,
and shall be punishable in accordance with the laws of the realm.
The High Council shall be charged with ensuring the dignity of the national flag is
upheld, and shall issue directives concerning its proper display, usage, and custody
throughout the kingdom and abroad.
This Act shall take full and immediate effect and be recorded among the laws of the
Kingdom of Arcadia for perpetual observance, with full collaboration with His Imperial Majesty, Holden Porter..</p>
