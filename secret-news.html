        <h1>Arcadian High Clearance Intelligence Portal</h1>
        <p class="classified">Clearance Level: Sovereign Eyes Only</p>

        <h2>Current Geopolitical Status</h2>
        <p>Arcadia remains in a precarious but strategically advantageous position following the ratification of the Treaty of Eternal Union with the Great Gheetan Empire. While formal sovereignty is preserved, the ongoing ambiguity in “supreme authority” clauses poses latent risks. Intelligence monitoring of Gheetan diplomatic channels reveals increased interest in asserting interpretive dominance over the Treaty.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Alliances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bradectoria</strong> – Confirmed alliance; diplomatic envoys exchanged weekly; high reliability partner.</li>
            <li><strong>Gheetan</strong> – Confirmes allience, however Treaty conflicts with Constitution. Be on high alert..</li>
            <li><strong>Flake Empire</strong> – Non-aligned. Arcadian intelligence recommends future outreach to prevent Empire expansion southward.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security Warnings</h2>
        <h3>None as of yet. Code green.</h3>
        <p>None as of yet. Code green.</p>

        <h3>Digital Espionage</h3>
        <p>Gheetan cyber units have escalated attempted entry on Arcadian government domains. Countermeasures have been deployed by the Arcadian Intelligence Directorate (AID), including honeypots and dual-auth cloaking layers.</p>

        <h2>Classified Initiatives</h2>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Operation FOXGLOVE:</strong> Secret deployal of arcadian troops into Bradectoria, Gheetan, and the Flake Empire.. Restricted access: Monarch & High Command only.</li>
            <li><strong>Codename "Iron Crown":</strong> Contingency plan for unilateral treaty withdrawal, to be executed if three redline clauses are violated. Legal framework pre-drafted, pending emergency Royal Council vote.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Public Manipulation Watch</h2>
        <p>Imperial-backed media narratives increasing in Arcadian outer provinces. Suggested response: activate Content Shield Protocol 9 and initiate cultural pride campaigns through the Arcadian Broadcast Trust.</p>

        <h2>Final Notes</h2>
        <p>High King has ordered internal review of all military, judicial, and legislative assets to assess long-term sustainability of national autonomy under the Treaty. National Integrity Index sits at 87%—slightly below threshold for passive operations.</p>
