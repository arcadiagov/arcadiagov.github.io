        <h2>URGENT: ARREST WARRANT FOR HIGH TREASON</h2>
        <p class="alert">
            üö® Urgent! Rowan Miller has confessed to High Treason. Immediate action is required. All officials are ordered to prioritize the execution of the Arrest Warrant as outlined below.  
        </p>
        <h3>Arrest Warrant Issued by the Lord High King of Arcadia</h3>
        <p>On the 29th of April, 2025, Rowan Miller, having confessed to terrorism and acts of subversion against the Kingdom of Arcadia, is to be apprehended immediately. The confession was made via email under the address: <strong>Rowan.D.Miller@outlook.com</strong>. This individual is to be arrested and brought to the Royal Court to face charges of High Treason.</p>

        <p>The following details are to be carried out by all law enforcement personnel and military units across Arcadia:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rowan Miller is to be detained upon identification. All methods of apprehension are authorized.</li>
            <li>Anyone assisting in the evasion or concealment of Rowan Miller will face charges of aiding and abetting treason.</li>
            <li>The individual is to be presented before the Royal Court at the earliest possible opportunity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Geopolitical Status</h2>
        <p>Arcadia remains in a precarious but strategically advantageous position following the ratification of the Treaty of Eternal Union with the Great Gheetan Empire. While formal sovereignty is preserved, the ongoing ambiguity in ‚Äúsupreme authority‚Äù clauses poses latent risks. Intelligence monitoring of Gheetan diplomatic channels reveals increased interest in asserting interpretive dominance over the Treaty.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Alliances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bradectoria</strong> ‚Äì Confirmed alliance; diplomatic envoys exchanged weekly; high reliability partner.</li>
            <li><strong>Gheetan</strong> ‚Äì Confirmed alliance, however Treaty conflicts with Constitution. Be on high alert..</li>
            <li><strong>Flake Empire</strong> ‚Äì Non-aligned. Arcadian intelligence recommends future outreach to prevent Empire expansion southward.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security Warnings</h2>
        <h3>Bradectoria Threat Assesment</h3>
        <p>Overview:
Bradectoria, once a longstanding ally under the Arcadian-Bradectorian Mutual Defense Compact, has formally declared war on the Kingdom of Arcadia as of February 2025. This marks a historic and deeply alarming shift in regional power dynamics. The declaration was not preceded by any formal grievances or negotiation efforts, and the act is viewed as a blatant betrayal of Arcadian trust and sovereignty.</p>

        <h3>Digital Espionage</h3>
        <p>Gheetan cyber units have escalated attempted entry on Arcadian government domains. Countermeasures have been deployed by the Arcadian Intelligence Directorate (AID), including dual-auth cloaking layers.</p>

        <h2>Classified Initiatives</h2>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Operation FOXGLOVE:</strong> Secret deployal of Arcadian troops into Bradectoria, Gheetan, and the Flake Empire.. Restricted access: Monarch & High Command only.</li>
            <li><strong>Codename "Iron Crown":</strong> Contingency plan for unilateral treaty withdrawal, to be executed if three redline clauses are violated. Legal framework pre-drafted, pending emergency Royal Council vote. More details are available
            upon request to those with Ultra Clearance, or may be requested at the bottom of this page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Public Manipulation Watch</h2>
        <p>Imperial-backed media narratives increasing in Arcadian outer provinces. Suggested response: activate Content Shield Protocol 9 and initiate cultural pride campaigns through the Arcadian Broadcast Trust.</p>

        <h2>Final Notes</h2>
        <p>High King has ordered internal review of all military, judicial, and legislative assets to assess long-term sustainability of national autonomy under the Treaty. National Integrity Index sits at 87%‚Äîslightly below threshold for passive operations.</p>
