      <h2>Bradictoria Cyber Division Shuts Down Restricted Access Page</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 20, 2025 – Department of Intermicronational Affairs</p>
      <p>
        In a precautionary move following increased attempts at unauthorized access, the Cyber Defence Division of the Empire of Bradictoria has officially shut down its restricted access webpage until further notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intelligence reports indicate that a wave of coordinated cyber-intrusion attempts—originating from unknown foreign sources—targeted the page's password validation framework. While no data breach has been confirmed, Bradictorian authorities state the shutdown is "a preventative security measure to safeguard national integrity."
      </p>
      <p>
        The restricted page had previously served as a classified resource hub for the Imperial Ministry of Online Security, led by Minister Lennox Steeves. Minister Steeves has not yet commented publicly, but a formal statement is expected in the coming days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allies and citizens have been advised to avoid suspicious links or communications claiming to represent the Bradictorian government.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restoration of the restricted site will follow once an internal audit and countermeasure implementation process has been completed.
