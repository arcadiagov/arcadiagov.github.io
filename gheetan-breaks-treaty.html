      <h2>Official Notice: Gheetan Violations of the Treaty of Eternal Union</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">June 4, 2025 – Royal Capital, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        The Government of the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia has compiled and now formally publishes the following record of repeated and material breaches of the <em>Treaty of Eternal Union</em> by the Great Gheetan Empire.
        These violations nullify all obligations of Arcadia under said treaty and provide clear legal grounds for withdrawal.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Violation of Article I – Sovereignty:</strong><br>
          Gheetan refused to recognize Arcadia as a sovereign party, instead classifying the High King as a subordinate “Imperial Official.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Violation of Article III, Clause 2 – Emergency Oversight:</strong><br>
          The Empire declared an imperial emergency and imposed a regent over Arcadia without consultation or consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Violation of Article IX – Non-Interference in Internal Affairs:</strong><br>
          Gheetan engaged in unauthorized surveillance, website penetration, and access of classified Arcadian defense protocols including Protocol Omega.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Violation of Article XIV – Recognition of Cultural Identity:</strong><br>
          Gheetan forced a change to the Arcadian crown title from “High King” to “Lord High King,” undermining national traditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Violation of Article XV – Peaceful Dispute Resolution:</strong><br>
          Gheetan issued criminal charges and a court summons against the High King without following the treaty’s mechanisms for peaceful dispute resolution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Violation of the Preamble – Mutual Respect and Equality:</strong><br>
          All actions taken by the Empire in recent weeks—including threats of trial, regency, and punishment—have violated the foundational principles of equality, dignity, and mutual trust upon which the treaty was based.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These violations are now formally recorded. The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia recognises its full right to terminate the Treaty of Eternal Union and resume independent sovereign status, free from imperial interference of any kind.
