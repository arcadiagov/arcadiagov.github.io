<main>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    The Arcadia Official News Channel exists to inform the public, represent the interests of the Kingdom of Arcadia, and uphold the values of truth, justice, and transparency. As the sanctioned source of official Arcadian communications, we publish all news with reverence for integrity, under the authority of His Lordship, the Lord High King of Arcadia.
  </p>

  <h2>Accuracy and Fact-Checking</h2>
  <p>
    We are committed to the publication of news that is as accurate, complete, and truthful as possible. All material undergoes verification by our editorial board. Sources must be reputable and cross-checked where feasible. Statements of fact are distinguished from opinion, and uncertainty is disclosed where it exists.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arcadian public, as well as our diplomatic allies and foreign observers, are entitled to rely on this channel as a trusted, factual, and stable reference point in matters of national and international importance.
  </p>

  <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
  <p>
    Although this channel is maintained under the Crown’s oversight, individual reports, features, and articles are produced by accredited correspondents, analysts, and editors exercising professional judgment and adherence to ethical norms. All final approvals are overseen by the Royal Office of Communications to ensure compliance with national standards.
  </p>

  <h2>Corrections and Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    In the rare event that a factual error is discovered, we commit to issuing a correction in a clear and transparent manner. Updated versions of articles will be marked appropriately with correction notices.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you identify an article or statement on this channel that you believe to be false, inaccurate, misleading, or lacking appropriate context, you are respectfully encouraged to notify the editorial board. Please provide clear references to the article in question, the nature of your concern, and any supporting information.

  </p>

  <h2>Ethical Standards and Bias Avoidance</h2>
  <p>
    Our editors and writers are bound by a duty to remain neutral and fair when reporting on national matters. While it is our role to defend the Kingdom’s interests, we also understand the sacred duty of the press to avoid unnecessary bias, distortion, or politically motivated defamation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Opinion pieces are clearly labeled. Satirical articles, where published, are noted explicitly to prevent confusion with factual reporting.
  </p>

  <h2>Public Engagement and Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    We welcome feedback from citizens, dignitaries, and allied nations. The integrity of Arcadian journalism is a collective responsibility, and public vigilance is essential. Constructive criticism is received with professionalism, and legitimate corrections are prioritized.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any malicious attempts to impersonate the Arcadia Official News Channel, distribute forged news in our name, or impersonate our correspondents will be met with legal prosecution under the laws of Arcadia and applicable international agreements.
  </p>

  <h2>Accessibility and Archiving</h2>
  <p>
    All official news is archived for historical, legal, and academic reference. These archives are managed by the Royal Bureau of Records and may be accessed by appointment or under special request.
  </p>

  <p>
    Content on this website is optimized for accessibility and will be continuously reviewed for compliance with modern standards, including compatibility with screen readers and mobile devices.
  </p>

  <h2>Legal and Copyright Notices</h2>
  <p>
    All news content is the intellectual property of the Kingdom of Arcadia unless otherwise credited. Unauthorized reproduction, modification, or redistribution without prior written permission is strictly prohibited.
