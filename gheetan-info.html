      <h2>About Gheetan & the State of Arcadia–Gheetan Relations</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">Last Updated: January 2026</p>

      <p>
        The Great Gheetan Empire has, for much of Arcadia’s modern history, occupied a complex and often
        contentious role in Arcadian governance and external affairs. Once bound by the Treaty of Eternal Union,
        the relationship between Arcadia and Gheetan has evolved through cooperation, strain, and ultimately,
        open conflict.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following the outbreak of hostilities between Arcadia and Gheetan in March of 2025, the two realms
        entered into a brief but consequential war that fundamentally altered the political landscape of the region.
        Though large-scale military operations have since ceased, relations remain tense and unresolved.
      </p>

      <h3>The March 2025 Conflict</h3>

      <p>
        The war of March 2025 was precipitated by a series of actions undertaken by the Emperor of Gheetan that
        Arcadia determined to be direct and material breaches of the Treaty of Eternal Union. These actions
        included unauthorized assertions of judicial authority, interference in Arcadian internal governance,
        and attempts to compel Arcadian compliance through threat of force and legal coercion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In response, the Arcadian government formally declared war, citing its inherent right to self-defense,
        sovereignty, and the preservation of constitutional order. The conflict, while limited in duration,
        marked a decisive rupture in what had already become an unsustainable imperial relationship.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Peace cannot be maintained where authority is imposed without consent, nor where treaties are wielded
        as instruments of domination rather than mutual respect.”
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Post-War Status: An Uneasy Peace</h3>

      <p>
        In the months following the cessation of open hostilities, Arcadia and Gheetan have settled into what
        may best be described as an uneasy peace. No comprehensive reconciliation or renewed treaty framework
        currently exists between the two states.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diplomatic contact is minimal and conducted, where necessary, through indirect or neutral channels.
        Arcadia continues to monitor Gheetan actions closely, while reaffirming its commitment to stability,
        lawful governance, and peaceful coexistence—so long as its sovereignty is respected.
      </p>

      <h3>Revocation of Gheetan Authority Within Arcadia</h3>

      <p>
        As a direct consequence of the Emperor’s treaty violations and subsequent escalation, all authority
        previously exercised by Gheetan officials within Arcadia has been formally and irrevocably revoked.
      </p>

      <p>
        No Gheetan court, official, decree, or imperial office holds legal standing within Arcadian territory.
        All powers once claimed under the Treaty of Eternal Union have been nullified by acts of the Arcadian
        Crown and government, restoring full internal and external sovereignty.
      </p>

      <p>
        This revocation was not undertaken lightly, but was deemed necessary to safeguard the rule of law,
        prevent further imperial overreach, and ensure that Arcadia’s governance remains accountable solely
        to its own people and institutions.
      </p>

      <h3>Current Position of the Arcadian Government</h3>

      <p>
        The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia recognizes Gheetan as a foreign power with whom it shares a difficult
        history. While Arcadia does not seek perpetual hostility, it will not accept subordination,
        extraterritorial control, or the resurrection of imperial authority by force or decree.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any future normalization of relations would require clear acknowledgment of Arcadia’s sovereignty,
        accountability for prior breaches, and the establishment of a new framework grounded in equality
        rather than empire.
      </p>
