      <h2>Bradictoria Declares War on Arcadia, Activates Code Purple Storm</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">June 4, 2025 – Royal Capital, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        In a dramatic and hostile escalation, the Empire of Bradictoria has formally declared a state of war against the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia. The declaration, issued by the Imperial Council and signed on behalf of Emperor Bradley Christie, was released earlier today under the title of an <strong>Imperial Decree</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The declaration cites obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Defense and Strategic Alliance with the Great Gheetan Empire, and refers to recent “hostile and unlawful actions” by Arcadia. No specific acts were listed publicly, but the document invokes a classified wartime directive known only as <strong>Code Purple Storm</strong>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Bradictoria does not enter war in haste, but neither does it retreat from its responsibilities... Let our enemies witness the resolve of an Empire bound by loyalty, forged in discipline, and shielded by honor.” — Imperial Decree, June 4
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The contents of Code Purple Storm remain sealed under Bradictorian Imperial Security Order 17-Ω. According to the decree, relevant departments and divisions of the Bradictorian military have received sealed instructions and are expected to act “with immediate compliance.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Arcadian government has not yet issued a formal counter-declaration, but sources close to the High Crown confirm that emergency defense protocols have been activated, and all military divisions placed on high alert. The Office of the High King described the Bradictorian decree as “unprovoked, imperialist, and entirely based on misinformation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Bradictoria now joins the Great Gheetan Empire in open conflict with Arcadia, marking a dangerous new phase in the rapidly escalating intermicronational crisis.
