      <h2>Circlet of Arcadia Forged and Bestowed Upon the Lord High King</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 23, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia has today marked a momentous occasion in its history: the official forging and bestowal of the newly created <strong>Circlet of Arcadia</strong> upon the Lord High King.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crafted by royal artisans using silver from the Mountains of Ardron and inlaid with sapphire stones representing the Seven Virtues of the Realm, the Circlet symbolizes the unity, strength, and enduring sovereignty of Arcadia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a private ceremony within the Citadel, the circlet was placed upon the head of His Lordship, the Lord High King, signifying the formal embodiment of the Crown's authority and his divine right to rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is not merely a symbol," stated the Royal Artificer, "but the living metal of Arcadia's will, shaped and crowned in truth."
      </p>
      <p>
        Officials confirm that the Circlet will now be worn during all state functions, war councils, and ceremonial audiences, marking the beginning of a new golden chapter in Arcadian sovereignty.
