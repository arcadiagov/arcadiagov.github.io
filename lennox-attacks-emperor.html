      <h2>Lennox Steeves Attacks Emperor of Bradictoria</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 21, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        Tensions between Arcadia and the self-proclaimed State of Bradictoria escalated today after Lennox Steeves, Minister of Online Security for Bradictoria, violently attacked Emperor Bradley Christie during a closed-door meeting in the Imperial Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sources close to the scene confirm that the assault was unprovoked and that Emperor Christie suffered multiple injuries before security forces intervened. Steeves was immediately restrained and removed from the palace grounds. His current whereabouts are reportedly unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arcadian officials issued an emergency statement denouncing the attack. “Arcadia does not tolerate political violence,” said a spokesperson for the Royal Diplomatic Office. “Although this incident is internal to Bradictoria, we are closely monitoring the situation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Emperor Christie, though shaken, is said to be in stable condition. Bradictoria has yet to issue a formal comment on the motive behind Steeves' aggression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumors of a long-standing rivalry between the two men have been circulating in diplomatic circles, particularly over disagreements in digital governance and inter-realm intelligence control. Lennox Steeves was previously under review for potential misconduct related to cross-border cyber operations.
