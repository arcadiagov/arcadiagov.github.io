      <h2>RAMP Issues Official Arrest Warrants for Identified Terrorists</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 2, 2025 – Capital City, Arcadia</p>
      <p>
        The Royal Arcadian Mounted Police (RAMP) has officially issued arrest warrants for multiple individuals believed to be directly responsible for recent terrorist activity across the Kingdom. The warrants were signed yesterday by His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the Great Gheetan Empire and His Lordship the Lord High King of Arcadia in a joint security ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
        The named individuals are accused of high treason, cyber espionage, subversion of the Crown, and endangerment of Arcadian civilians. These warrants are now in full effect and grant RAMP and all affiliated enforcement divisions immediate authority to pursue and detain the suspects wherever they may be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This is not merely a legal measure — it is a declaration of our intent to bring justice to those who would see the Realm fall into chaos,” stated the Lord High King. “These terrorists will face the full power of our law.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizens are urged to report any information relating to the whereabouts or activities of the named suspects to RAMP headquarters or through official intelligence channels. Harboring or aiding the fugitives is punishable under Section 9 of the Arcadian Penal Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full list of active arrest warrants is available on the Kingdom’s official site, under the Ministry of Internal Security records.
