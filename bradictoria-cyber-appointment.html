      <h2>Bradictoria Appoints Convicted Cyber Criminal as Minister of Online Security</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">May 15, 2025 – Port Grandhall, Bradictoria</p>
      <p>
        In a stunning announcement, the Bradictorian government has appointed Lennox Steeves — a convicted cybercriminal recently tried and sentenced in absentia by Arcadia — as its new Minister of Online Security. The appointment, which comes just days after Arcadian authorities confirmed his conviction, has sparked immediate concern among allied states.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steeves, who was found guilty of cyber espionage, subversion of protected systems, and high-level data infiltration, is believed to have reached a classified agreement with Bradictorian officials in exchange for internal intelligence on “Arcadian digital strategy and counter-intrusion measures.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “This is not just an insult — it is an escalation,” said a senior aide to the Lord High King. “Bradictoria has knowingly elevated a known traitor to a position of strategic influence.”
      </p>
      <p>
        While Arcadia has not issued a formal diplomatic protest, security analysts within Arcadia have expressed dismay over the decision, warning that Bradictoria’s move could destabilize ongoing cybersecurity cooperation between friendly states.
