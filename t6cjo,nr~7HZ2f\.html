      <h2>Structure of Government</h2>
      <p>
        The Kingdom of Arcadia operates under a sovereign constitutional monarchy, blending centralized royal authority with noble and advisory institutions. At its highest level, executive and legislative powers are vested in the <strong>Lord High King</strong> and the <strong>High Council</strong>, both of whom oversee the administration of law, governance, and national security.
      </p>

      <h2>The Lord High King</h2>
      <p>
        The Lord High King serves as the Head of State and the supreme ruler of Arcadia, appointed by a predecessor and serving for life. The Lord High King holds expansive powers including the right to declare war, mint currency, manage intercolonial and international affairs, and oversee national defense and taxation. However, constitutional constraints—particularly around amendments—ensure a degree of balance and accountability through the Head of State and High Council.
      </p>

      <h2>The High Council</h2>
      <p>
        The High Council functions as a legislative and advisory body composed of trusted nobles, appointed representatives, and ministers. While the High King retains supreme authority, the Council plays a key role in advising, legislating, and ensuring continuity in state governance.
      </p>

      <h2>Regency and Succession</h2>
      <p>
        In cases of succession, the Lord High King may appoint a Regent to govern for a period of thirteen months before a new Head of State formally ascends. This interim period ensures stability and continuity in leadership.
      </p>

      <h2>Arcadia and the Empire</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with the <strong>Treaty of Eternal Union</strong>, the Kingdom of Arcadia stands in alliance with the <strong>Great Gheetan Empire</strong>. This treaty formalizes mutual defense, cooperative governance on inter-imperial matters, and recognition of Arcadia’s internal sovereignty. While Arcadia retains its constitutional independence and authority under the Lord High King, it participates in shared frameworks with the Empire in areas such as diplomacy, trade, and continental defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Treaty outlines that no unilateral laws or directives from the Empire may override Arcadia’s internal Constitution, and that Arcadia's representatives are to be included in all imperial councils and assemblies that may affect the realm.
      </p>

      <h2>Equality and Rule of Law</h2>
      <p>
        The Constitution of Arcadia guarantees equal eligibility for all citizens—regardless of race, religion, or age—to hold public office. The nation remains guided by a strong rule-of-law framework, with rights and duties clearly enshrined and protected under the supreme legal authority of the Constitution.
