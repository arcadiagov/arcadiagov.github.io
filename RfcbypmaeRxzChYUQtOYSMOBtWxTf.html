  <h2>Gavin Jones</h2>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Status:</span> Civilian — Under Surveillance</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Documents Affiliated:</span> High Council Application (Denied)</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Information:</span>
    Gavin Jones is a private individual who has declared a self-proclaimed micronation and submitted an application to the Arcadian High Council for recognition. He currently holds no official position or title within Arcadia or its affiliates.
  </div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Concerns:</span>
    His intentions are hostile, and the legitimacy and implications of the micronation proposal are under active review. Gavin Jones has recently attempted to force the High King into the position of Governor General of the Gavonion Isles, a territory he unilaterally created. Arcadia is currently on high alert, and Jones is under surveillance.
  </div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Timestamp:</span> April 30, 2025 — Incident Recorded</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Incident Report:</span>
    Gavin Jones initiated an unsolicited and unauthorized diplomatic maneuver attempting to assign the High King a subordinate administrative role within the self-declared Gavonion Isles. This act has been classified as a sovereignty breach attempt. Surveillance is active. No formal arrest warrant has yet been issued, pending further investigation. Subsequently, Gavin Jones has declared intent to assassinate either the Lord High King of Arcadia or the Emperor of the Great Gheetan Empire. His High Council application has been formally denied. Case has been flagged for automatic review by the Gheetan Emperor and Arcadian Royal Security Command. Jones is now under constant surveillance.

  <h2>Bradley Christie</h2>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Status:</span> Self-Proclaimed Emperor of Bradectoria</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Documents Affiliated:</span> N/A</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Information:</span>
    Bradley Christie is the self-declared Emperor of Bradectoria, a micronational entity with limited recognition. The Emperor of Gheetan, Holden Porter, has explicitly ordered that Bradectoria not be officially recognized by any sovereign state, including Arcadia. Despite this, Christie maintains personal relations with various diplomats and has a known friendship with Rowan Miller, a wanted fugitive in Arcadia.
  </div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Concerns:</span>
    The lack of official recognition and Christie's association with Rowan Miller, a known terrorist, raises potential security risks. Surveillance and diplomatic caution are recommended, particularly with respect to any attempt to seek support from other unrecognized micronations or unofficial channels.
  </div>

    <div class="profile-card">
  <h2>Isaac Bell</h2>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Status:</span> Deceased — Former Emperor of the Flake Empire</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Documents Affiliated:</span> Flake Empire Charter, Assassination Report</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Information:</span>
    Isaac Bell was the self-declared Emperor of the Flake Empire, a micronation he attempted to establish. The Flake Empire lasted for only one month before its sudden collapse due to internal instability and external pressure. Bell was assassinated under mysterious circumstances shortly after the dissolution of the Flake Empire, which was considered a failed attempt at sovereignty. His efforts to create a new entity were met with widespread resistance from both local authorities and international powers.
  </div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Concerns:</span>
    Although the Flake Empire was short-lived, Bell's assassination remains under investigation. There are ongoing concerns about potential factions that supported his empire or benefited from its brief existence, which may still be in play. Surveillance of his former associates and any ongoing activities connected to the Flake Empire is advised.
  </div>
</div>
    <div class="profile-card">
  <h2>Dexter Welling</h2>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Status:</span> Former High King of Arcadia, Impeached</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Documents Affiliated:</span> Impeachment Documents, Royal Diplomatic Records</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Information:</span>
    Dexter Welling served as the first High King of Arcadia. However, his reign ended abruptly when he was impeached after committing **Grand Larceny** and destroying crucial documents bearing the Royal Seal and Signature. These actions were deemed a direct violation of Arcadian law, undermining both the monarchy and national security. Before his impeachment, Welling held a diplomatic position, representing Arcadia in various international matters. However, following his removal from office, he is no longer affiliated with Arcadia.
  </div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Concerns:</span>
    Dexter Welling's impeachment has left a permanent stain on Arcadian history. While no longer in power or affiliated, his prior actions have raised concerns about internal corruption within the Arcadian government. Surveillance and caution are advised with regards to any of his former diplomatic associates or potential factions that may seek to restore his influence.
  </div>
</div>
    <div class="profile-card">
  <h2>Logan Boucher</h2>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Status:</span> Fugitive — Disgraced Former Head of State</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Documents Affiliated:</span> Royal Discharge Decree, Arrest Warrant, Diplomatic Incident Reports</div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Information:</span>
    Logan Boucher held office as Head of State of Arcadia during a volatile period in the Kingdom’s history. His brief tenure was marked by reckless decision-making and unauthorized threats of war against both the Great Gheetan Empire and the Republic of Bradectoria. These actions violated multiple provisions of his sworn oath to the High King and irreparably damaged Arcadia’s diplomatic posture.
    <br><br>
    Following a formal Royal Discharge and unanimous High Council condemnation, Boucher was stripped of his office and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He remains at large.
  </div>
  <div class="profile-section"><span class="label">Concerns:</span>
    Boucher’s inflammatory rhetoric and defiance of royal authority severely undermined Arcadian foreign policy and national credibility. While no longer considered a high-level threat due to his loss of influence and support, the Kingdom maintains an active search protocol. Surveillance is recommended, particularly for political groups sympathetic to his past actions.
