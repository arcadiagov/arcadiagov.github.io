        <h2>Logan Boucher Confesses to Poisoning Emperor of Bradictoria</h2>
        <p class="timestamp">June 3, 2025</p>
        <p>
          The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia confirms that Logan Boucher has formally confessed to the attempted poisoning of His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Bradley Christie of Bradictoria. This confession follows an extensive and confidential investigation conducted by Arcadian security forces and forensic experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The act, which involved the deliberate contamination of the Emperor’s personal drinking water, resulted in a critical medical emergency and a heightened state of alert throughout the Bradictorian Empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arcadian authorities emphasize that the confession was unsolicited and that no official Arcadian body sanctioned or condoned this act of violence. Mr. Boucher is currently detained under strict custody pending trial before the Realm Tribunal of Arcadia.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "While we condemn all forms of extrajudicial violence, the Kingdom Realm of Arcadia upholds the principles of legal due process and sovereign jurisdiction. This confession brings much-needed clarity to an incident shrouded in misinformation and political manipulation," said a spokesperson for the Lord High King.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Imperial Court of Bradictoria has responded with heightened diplomatic tensions, demanding the extradition of Boucher and threatening retaliatory measures. The Kingdom Realm of Arcadia rejects these demands and reiterates its commitment to lawful procedures and sovereign independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medical updates confirm the Emperor remains in guarded recovery. The Arcadian government has extended offers of medical cooperation through neutral channels, though no formal response has been received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further developments will be reported as the legal proceedings advance.
